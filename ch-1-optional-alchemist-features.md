# Chapter 1: Optional Alchemist Features

The options presented below can be selected by any Alchemist.

You gain class features in the _Systems Reference Document_ when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain as an Alchemist. Unlike the features in the _SRD_ or the _[Alchemist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FbBScXvWzPKRo62ZlqXcIMgUd_KPYoqCkMa2ZtYBN8c)_ document, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your Dungeon Master, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

If you take a feature that replaces another feature, you gain no benefit from the replaced one and don't qualify for anything in the game that requires it.

### [Additional Alchemist's Potions](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-classes/blob/main/third-party/alchemist/options-additional-alchemists-potions.md)

_Alchemist feature_

The potions in the following list expand the [Alchemist's Potions list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y5ia5NRk0sKFpsoFI8unjEsPqT_NHKUVG8paACWJtIM). The list is organized by potion size. See [Chapter 3: Alchemist's Potions](ch-3-additional-alchemists-potions.md) for full potion descriptions.

##### Alchemist's Potions

### [Alteration Options](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-classes/blob/main/third-party/alchemist/options-alterations.md)

_2nd-level Alchemist feature_

When you choose Alchemist's Potion alteration options, you have access to the following additional options.

##### Aged Brew

- **Additional Materials:** a bottle of wine worth 10 gp
- **Alchemy Points:** 0

When spending alchemy points to refresh an Alchemist's Potion that has lost potency, subtract 1 from the total alchemy point cost (minimum cost 1 AP). The Aged Brew alteration doesn't count against the total number of alterations applied to a potion, and it lasts until the potion loses its potency again, after which it can be reapplied to the same potion to refresh it again. After you use this alteration, you regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest.

### [Aura Options](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-classes/blob/main/third-party/alchemist/options-auras.md)

_3rd-level House of Adornments feature_

When you choose an aura to imbue in a gem, you have access to the following additional options.

##### Alchemical Aura

- **Duration:** same as the potion recipe

You infuse a gem with the chemical essence of a potion recipe you know that creates an area of effect when thrown. When the aura is activated, the gem applies the throw effect of the potion recipe to the area around the gem for the potion’s duration, replacing the potion’s original splash area with the aura’s radius. If the potion’s throw effect requires targeting a creature, the gem’s holder is used as the target, but no attack roll is required; any effect on a hit applies automatically.

Infusing a gem with a potion recipe requires spending a number of alchemy points equal to the potion’s cost. Additional alchemy points can be spent to upsize the potion effects or to apply a compatible alteration, imparting the same benefits to the gem aura when activated.

Potion effects applied to gem auras follow all normal rules for potion brewing, including material component cost, upsizing limitations, and alteration prerequisites.
